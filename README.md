A QR menu service landing page with a hand-drawn aesthetic. This project recreates a prototype I built previously, now using Bootstrap for the first time.

## About This Project

This is a learning project for Code Institute where I explored Bootstrap framework. The design features a sketch-style interface that makes it feel handcrafted and approachable for restaurant owners.

## What I Built

- Responsive landing page with sign-up form
- Documentation page with service information
- Hand-drawn design using CSS pseudo-elements
- Mobile-friendly layout with Bootstrap grid

### Sign-Up Form

### Mobile Responsive

## Design Details

### Custom Border Effect

The signature hand-drawn border uses CSS `::before` pseudo-elements with rotation to create an imperfect, sketchy look.

## Key Features

✓ Sketch-style borders using CSS `::before` pseudo-elements  
✓ Custom CSS variables for consistent design  
✓ Responsive layout that works on all devices  
✓ Interactive button hover effects  
✓ Clean, semantic HTML5 structure  

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand:
- Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes
- CSS pseudo-elements for creating visual effects
- Building responsive layouts without writing media queries from scratch
- Organizing CSS with custom properties
- Creating consistent design systems with CSS variables
